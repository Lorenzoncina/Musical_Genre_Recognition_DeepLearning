# Musical_Genre_Recognition_DeepLearning
Musical Genre recognition system designed with a deep learning approach.
I implemented 3 different type of network architecture to solve this problem:
-MLP (Multy layer parceprton)
-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
-RNN-LSTM (Recurrent neural network)

Inspired by Valerio Velardo's serie about Deep Learning for audio:
