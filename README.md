# Musical Genre Recognition with DeepLearning
Musical Genre recognition system designed with a deep learning approach

#### I implemented 3 different type of network architecture to solve this problem:
* MLP (Multy layer parceprton)
* CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
* RNN-LSTM (Recurrent neural network)

The dataset used to train the networks is the GTZAN Genre collection and can be dowloaded here:
